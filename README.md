#Earth Hour App

*CloudFlare App for Earth Day*

###How it works
The app will darken your site for Earth Hour for the time the site owner sets in the Apps page on CloudFlare.

The site becomes inaccessible but slightly visible around the overlay.

The darkness leaves and accessibility returns after the hour is up.

###Limitations
The app can only see browser time, so the hour set will only count from the user's standpoint. So, best practice is to set it and leave it. It won't turn on again until next year.
